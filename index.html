			<h3>A little about myself</h3>	
			<p>
There is so much to talk about in such a short amount of space. My name in Benjamin Marley Foley. I am currently enrolled in OSU computer science degree. I am currently 25 years old. I am originally from Maine and moved here when I was 19 for adventure. I have had a slew of jobs in the past 6 years. I started working at Mt. Bachelor and progressed my skiing to heights I didnâ€™t know were imaginable. Then I dabbled in the restaurant business for about 4 years working at Bistro 28 and Worthy Brewery. This led to me making many friends along the way. About mid-way through the restaurant business I became a sort of dog walker/ caretaker. I am now taking care of a women named Neil Fingerhut. We are good friends as I take her dog out for walks every day. There have been some bumps on my winding road but somehow, I always have a smile on my face and try to look at life Happily.
