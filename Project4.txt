Resume
I haven't done a ton of work in my years but I can start with my first job being a camp counseler for 2 years. I worked with kids and taught a variety of sports. I then moved to Oregon where I got a job at Mt. Bachelor in lift ops. After the ski season was over I picked up restaruant buisness and lead two places as the lead expoditor. Both of those places were Bistro 28 and Worthy Brewery. I was basically in charge of all the food that left the kitchen and made sure everything was right. During this time I also picked up dog walking. I have been a proud dog walker for 3 years. Then Covid hit and now I go to school and walk dogs.
